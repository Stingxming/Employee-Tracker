# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

## User Story

AS an owner of a small business
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business according to its needs!

To do so, I have started building an application that is sever based and runs off of the command line. It's not quite finished yet and I've started a major overhaul of refactoring the logic in my index.js file but I hope to have made much more progress on this by the end of the week.
